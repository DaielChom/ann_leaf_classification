# Leaf classification using ANNs
This repositorie tries to solve the classification task in the kaggle's competition **[leaf_classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/overview)**

#In notebook 05 - A one-dimensional convolutional neural network model is used to classify leaves by features you should get a good precision result after training the model with the data and contracting it with the test data.

In notebook 06 - A three-layer convolutional neural network model is used to try to classify the leaves by means of flattened images, you get several graphs one of the losses with respect to the steps and also other of the weights in layers 1 and 3 where you notice that the weights you are gained information, but without satisfactory results at the end.

In notebook 07 - A convolutional neural network model with several layers is used, starting with a convolutional layer of two dimensions, then with several dense layers, in addition it was also tested with batch normalization and Dropout layers to try to classify the leaves by means of binary images more quickly and efficiently, in the end you get the accuracy and confusion matrices but without very good results at the end
